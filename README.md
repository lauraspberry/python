# python
This repository is for python code I developed.

Contents: 
* Hangman Game and Assets (uses python turtle)
* Texting Program (sends iMessages automatically)
* Tester Files (just me playing around with python)

steps to learn more coding:
1. learn more about github 
2. brainstorm project ideas 
3. plan out schedule + times to work
4. work on projects! :)
bonus: github tutorials have been very helpful (:
