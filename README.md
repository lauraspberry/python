# python
This repository is for python code I developed.
Some ideas for potential projects:
1. learn more about github 
the youtube video I watched before is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNq2kIvi9s
the one mom recommended is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYvkMv7LzCw&list=RDCMUCvzlnZbePin9kH-1JCKBt8Q&index=2
1.5 recall how to make ur own webpage on safari
i think i've done the localhost here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPo6BDvaAQo
This doesn't seem to match what I had done at AIHacks :( I wonder if there is any way to retrieve the info and process I took back then.
2. brainstorm project ideas (techwithtim had some ideas to start)
* atari games
* mom's idea of stocks
* my idea of recordings
3. plan out schedule + times to work
4. work on projects! :)

note: pong.py and hangman.py work!
